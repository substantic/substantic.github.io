title: Hyperparameter Search on a Cluster (Part 2)
layout: post

The goal of this text is to show a simple hyperparameter on a cluster computer
by using [Rain](https://github.com/substantic/rain).
In [Part 1](https://substantic.github.io/2018/09/05/hsearch1.html), we have run
hyperparameter search on MNIST. For testing purpose, we did the computation on
localhost.

In this part, we execute the script on a real cluster on
[Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/) infrastructure. More preciselly, we start
Rain server and working processes on Exoscale cluster by our script. Starting
Rain manually or on a different infrastructure is described in the
[manual](https://substantic.github.io/rain/docs/install.html).

## Preparations

In this text, we expect that you have an account at Exoscale and you have properly
configured `.cloudstack.ini` (how to do it is described [here](https://github.com/exoscale/cs)).

For setting up infrastructure, we use
[exoscale.py](https://github.com/substantic/rain/tree/master/utils/deployment/exoscale)
from Rain repository.

Also make sure that following ports are allowed in your firewall settings:

* 7210 for client connection
* 7222 for dashboard


## Starting machines

We start with allocating machines on Exoscale:

```
python3 exoscale.py create -n <N> --name mnist-test --keypair <KEYPAIR>
```

where:

- ``<N>`` is the number of machines we ask ask for
- ``<KEYPAIR>`` is the name SSH keypair, ``python3 exoscale.py create --help`` will list available keys

This command creates file ``default.env`` in the current working directory that
contains information about cluster allocation. This file will be read by the
following commands. If you want to have more running instancies, you can use
argument ``--env`` to specify another environment file.

## Setting up an environment

First we install tensorflow on all our machines:

```
python3 exoscale.py cmd "pip3 install tensorflow"
```

Then we install Rain and start it:

```
python3 exoscale.py install --rain-download 0.4.0
python3 exoscale.py start
```

The last command starts Rain and give us a server IP of running Rain server. If
you forget the address, you can always run ``python3 exoscale.py list-nodes``
and the first listed node where server is running.

## Running MNIST example

At this point, we have a machines in Exoscale infrastructure that is ready to
accept Rain tasks. Now, all we need to do is set up IP address of the server in
our MNIST script.

In the following line in MNIST script:

```python
client = Client("localhost", 7210)
```

replace "localhost" by server IP address:

```python
client = Client("<YOUR-SERVER-IP>", 7210)
```

Now we can run the script and the hyper parameters search will be
executed on the cluster. You can also observe the behavior on the dashboard
that is running at ``http://<YOUR-SERVER-IP>:7222``.

## Destroying instances

When we do not need allocated machines, we can dispose them by the following
command. Note that it deletes ``default.env``.

```
python3 exoscale.py destroy
```
