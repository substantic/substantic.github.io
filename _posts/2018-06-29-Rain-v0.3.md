tl;dr You can write task your own tasks in C++ and Rust now, we have reworked
metadata for tasks and objects and overall imroved the Python API.

We have just released version 0.3.0 of [Rain](http://rain.readthedocs.io/), a
framework for executing parallel pipelines. This release brings lots of changes, both
internal and external. In this text, we would like to summarize them together
with a motivation.

## Custom tasks in Rust and C++

The big news is a possibility to create your own tasks in C++ and Rust. In
version 0.3.0 you can create *executors* (formerly known as subworkers) that
provide some predefined tasks. We have created libraries for C++ and Rust that
allows you to simply create such executors. In other words, if you have some
code that you want to expose as tasks in Rain, you simply wrap it by our
library. The resulting program is a working executor that knows how to
communicate with a *governor* (formerly worker). In the current version, Rust
library is almost complete; the C++ library is working but provides only the
basic functionality.

## Public node attributes

The second large change is stabilization of "attributes" - 
the metadata for tasks and data objects. Each task and data object stores
two sets of attributes: `spec` (specification of task/object, i.e. configuration,
dependencies, scheduler hints, etc.) and `info` (attributes created at runtime,
i.e. where was task executed, task duration, error messages). Both spec and info
can contain also user-defined attributes that can contain any JSON-serializable
data. This gives the user possibility to send and receive small (meta)data from
tasks.

## Python task API

Another visible change is refactoring of Python API for tasks. We have
refactored API to be more "pythonic". Among some smaller changes such as better
attribute checking and consistent attributes orders, the big one is that each
task type is now represented by a class. This is mainly relevant for people
creating own tasks, but others may see the change as capitalization of "task
factories" in tasks module, e.g. tasks.execute is now tasks. Execute, as they
are now classes, not functions. Being aware that this change breaks
compatibility, we believe it was necessary to make the usage of Rain more
intuitive. Based on our experience, people are sometimes confused about the idea
of building a "plan of computation" that is actually executed after submission.
We hope that using the capital letters will help to explain that tasks. Execute
only creates a node in a task graph but do not run the computation.

## Distribution

We have also news in the distribution of packages. The Rain infrastructure and
library for writing Rust packages are now installable by `cargo install rain_server`
or as a `Cargo.toml` dependency. The Python client and task API
is published at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rain-python/) and installable by
`pip install rain-python` (note that Rain needs Python 3).

## Other changes

We have renamed some of the Rain components as follows: "worker" ->
"governor" and "subworker" -> "executor". If you are not familiar with the old names,
good for you and you can skip ignore paragraph; the reason behind the rename is
to avoid confusing worker with either the local manager (now called governor) or the
actual task executor process (now executor).
A governor is the local manager of the resources
and data objects on a computational node (In the similar sense as the server is
manager of the cluster). The tasks are performed by executor,
that was renamed from "subworker" as the original name misleading.

We are now supporting [the arrow format](https://arrow.apache.org/) in `load`/`encode`,
and lots of other minor bugs were fixed in many places. There were also some
smaller tweaks in the dashboard. We know that the dashboard needs more care.
This is a quite high priority in our TODO list for the next release - you can track
the plan in the [v0.4 milectone](https://github.com/substantic/rain/milestone/2)
but it will be fleshed out only later in the summer (we like vacations too!).
We plan major improvement of dashboard together with new functionality to propagate
custom data from tasks to the dashboard (e.g. a chart with some internal
values).

There are also two internal changes that are almost invisible to users, but had
quite a large impact in the code. Both of them are on the long way of
refactoring our RPC that probably ends by removing `capnp` from Rain. The first is
refactoring of data fetching API, that was simplified and does not relly on
capnp "capabilities". As a side-effect of this, we have implemented better
caching of serialized directories. The other change is a complete revamp of the
protocol between governor and executor. In this place, capnp was completely
replaced by a simple protocol based on exchanging CBOR messages. This allows to
develop new executors in almost in any language.
