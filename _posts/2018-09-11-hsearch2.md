* [Part 2](https://substantic.github.io/2018/09/11/hsearch2.html): Hyperparameter search pipeline **distributed** on Exoscale cloud
* [Part 3](https://substantic.github.io/2018/09/28/hsearch3.html): Employing external programs

The goal of this blog post is to demonstrate how to use
[Rain](https://github.com/substantic/rain) for a **distributed** hyperparameter
search on a cloud infrastructure. In our [previous blog
post](https://substantic.github.io/2018/09/05/hsearch1.html), we described
hyperparameter search for the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
dataset using Rain in a single node environment.

This time, we use a virtualized cluster deployed at
[Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/) infrastructure. We provide a
[script](https://github.com/substantic/rain/tree/master/utils/deployment/exoscale)
that makes it easy to deploy Rain on Exoscale environment and lets you start
processing your workloads distributedly right away. It allows you to deploy a set
of virtual machines and provisions a distributed Rain infrastructure in just a
few minutes. Of course, you can always start the Rain components on any standard
distributed infrastructure manually ([read the
documentation](https://substantic.github.io/rain/docs/install.html) for more
information).

A big thanks go to our friends at Exoscale for providing us the resources for
testing Rain on their infrastructure!

## Preparations

In this blog post, we expect that you have an account at Exoscale and you have
properly configured  your `.cloudstack.ini` config file (how to do this is well
described [here](https://github.com/exoscale/cs)). We also expect that you have
an SSH keypair that allows you to access the virtual machines.

Next, make sure that following ports are allowed for outside access in your
firewall settings:

* 7210 for client connection
* 7222 for dashboard

For setting up the infrastructure, we use
[exoscale.py](https://github.com/substantic/rain/tree/master/utils/deployment/exoscale)
from the Rain repository.


## Starting machines

We start with deploying a set of virtual machines on Exoscale:

```
python3 exoscale.py create -n <N> --name mnist-test --keypair <KEYPAIR>
```

where:

- ``<N>`` is the number of machines to spin up
- ``<KEYPAIR>`` is the name SSH keypair; ``python3 exoscale.py create --help`` lists available keys

This command creates a set of virtual machines on Exoscale and also creates a
local file ``default.env`` in the current working directory. This file is used
by other subcommands of the script as the reference to the created cluster. If
you want to maintain more running environments at the same time, you can use
argument ``--env`` to specify another environment file.


## Setting up an environment

First, we install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) on all our machines:

```
python3 exoscale.py cmd "pip3 install tensorflow"
```

Then, we install Rain and start it:

```
python3 exoscale.py install --rain-download 0.4.0
python3 exoscale.py start
```

The last command starts Rain and gives us a server IP of running Rain server. If
you forget the address, you can always run ``python3 exoscale.py list-nodes``
and the first listed node is the one where the server runs.

## Running MNIST example

At this point, we have a distributed Rain infrastructure up and running. Rain
server is ready to receive tasks from the client. To run our MNIST example
from the previous blog post on this infrastructure, all we need to do is to
point the client to the remote Rain server IP address.

To do so, find the following line in the MNIST script:

```python
client = Client("localhost", 7210)
```

and replace "localhost" by the actual server IP address:

```python
client = Client("<YOUR-SERVER-IP>", 7210)
```

Now, run the script and the hyperparameter search will be executed on the
cluster. You can monitor the execution in the Rain dashboard that is running at
``http://<YOUR-SERVER-IP>:7222``.

## Destroying instances

The allocated machines can be disposed by the following command. (Note, that, if
not specified explicitely, it only destroys the VMs from ``default.env``.)

```
python3 exoscale.py destroy
```
