We are researchers, developers and teachers in distributed and HPC computing, modelling and algorithms, with strong backgrounds in apllied computer science research and projects.

## Rain

[Rain](http://rain.readthedocs.io/) is our contribution to the opensource HPC community; a distributed computing framework that is simple to use and deploy, yet powerful and scalable for huge workloads, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for safety and efficiency. Get it at [github](https://github.com/substantic/rain/) or take a look at the [guidebook](http://rain.readthedocs.io/).
